## Stage 1: Model Development & Local Testing

Stage 1 focuses on developing models using different federated learning approaches and conducting initial local validation. Each approach serves a specific purpose in understanding federated learning effectiveness.

### Approach 1: Cross-Site Model Validation

#### Objective
Test the generalization capability of a centralized model across diverse healthcare sites without any local training.

#### Implementation Process
1. **Central Training**: RUSH trains models on their complete 2018-2022 dataset
2. **Model Distribution**: RUSH shares trained models with all federated sites
3. **Local Evaluation**: Each site evaluates the RUSH model on their 2023-2024 test data
4. **Performance Collection**: All sites report performance metrics back to coordination center

#### Models Trained
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting with optimized hyperparameters

- Secure model distribution mechanism

### Approach 2: Transfer Learning with Main Model Initialization

#### Objective
Leverage the RUSH pre-trained model as initialization for site-specific fine-tuning, enabling personalized models while benefiting from centralized knowledge.

#### Implementation Process
1. **Base Model**: RUSH provides pre-trained models (trained on 2018-2022 data)
2. **Local Fine-tuning**: Each site fine-tunes the base model using their 2018-2022 training data
3. **Local Testing**: Each site evaluates their fine-tuned model on their own 2023-2024 test data
4. **Model Sharing**: Sites upload their fine-tuned models to BOX folder for Stage 2 analysis

#### Fine-tuning Strategy
- **Learning Rate**: Reduced learning rate (0.1x of original) for stable fine-tuning
- **Training Duration**: Early stopping based on local validation performance
- **Layer Strategy**: Full model fine-tuning (all layers trainable)
- **Data Split**: 50% local training data for fine-tuning, maintaining 50% for potential validation

#### Expected Outcomes

### Approach 4: Round Robin Federated Training

#### Objective
Implement collaborative sequential training where models are passed between sites, accumulating knowledge from multiple data sources while maintaining data privacy.

#### Implementation Process
1. **Initialization**: First site (RUSH) trains initial model on their 2018-2022 data
2. **Model Passing**: Model sequentially passed to each participating site
3. **Incremental Training**: Each site continues training the received model on their local 2018-2022 data
4. **Final Model**: After complete round, final model tested on each site's 2023-2024 data
5. **Model Collection**: Final round robin models uploaded to BOX for Stage 2

#### Round Robin Protocol
- **Training Order**: Predetermined sequence of sites for model passing
- **Training Epochs**: Fixed number of epochs per site to ensure balanced contribution

### Phase 2: Ensemble Construction & Testing

#### Objective
Create and evaluate ensemble models using simple, practical combination strategies that are suitable for real clinical deployment.

#### Ensemble Strategies

##### 1. Simple Average Ensemble
- **Method**: Equal weighting of all available models (excluding local site's model)
- **Implementation**: `ensemble_prediction = mean([model1_pred, model2_pred, ..., modelN_pred])`
- **Rationale**: Unbiased baseline approach, simplest to implement and explain clinically
- **Advantage**: No complex weighting decisions, transparent and interpretable

##### 2. Local Accuracy Weighted Ensemble
- **Method**: Weight models based on their local AUC performance from Stage 1
- **Implementation**: `ensemble_prediction = Σ(weight_i × model_i_prediction)` where `weight_i ∝ local_AUC_i`
- **Rationale**: Performance-driven approach that gives more influence to better-performing models
- **Advantage**: Clinically intuitive, evidence-based weighting, easy to validate and audit

#### Leave-One-Out Testing Protocol

**Unbiased Evaluation Strategy:**
- **At Site A**: Create ensembles using models from Sites B, C, D, E, F, G only (exclude Site A's models)
- **At Site B**: Create ensembles using models from Sites A, C, D, E, F, G only (exclude Site B's models)
- **Continue for each participating site**

This ensures unbiased evaluation and prevents overfitting to local data patterns.

#### Implementation Process
1. **Model Collection**: Gather all models shared via BOX folder from Stage 1
2. **Local Model Exclusion**: For each site, exclude their own models from ensemble pool
3. **Ensemble Construction**: Create both simple average and accuracy-weighted ensembles
4. **Local Testing**: Test both ensemble methods on site's local 2023-2024 test data
5. **Performance Comparison**: Compare ensemble performance vs best individual model

#### Testing Protocol
- **Test Scope**: Each site tests both ensembles on their LOCAL 2023-2024 test data only
- **Comparison Baseline**: Compare ensemble performance against best individual models
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform significance testing of ensemble improvements
- **Clinical Interpretability**: Assess ease of explanation and clinical acceptance

#### Expected Outcomes
- Demonstration of ensemble effectiveness using simple, practical methods
- Identification of optimal ensemble strategy for clinical deployment
- Evidence of ensemble improvement over individual federated approaches
- Recommendations for real-world deployment strategy

#### Real Deployment Recommendation
**Primary Choice: Local Accuracy Weighted Ensemble**
- Most clinically acceptable and interpretable
